these are just some notes for myself

fs = file system, used for dealing with files
needs to be defined as a var at the beginning

path is self explanatory, needs to be defined at the beginning



gonna practice some js promises / await + async exercises cuz I've never dealt with it
gonna write more notes when I'm done
